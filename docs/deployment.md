# Deployment

Status: **CURRENT — HOSTED WEB/PWA TARGET; LOCAL PACKAGE RETIRED**
Updated: `2026-08-31`

FamilyFoodOS targets:

```text
hosted responsive Web/PWA
→ hosted Application API
→ domain/services
→ repositories
→ production database
```

ADR 0031 retires the inherited macOS consumer `.app` / ZIP. Source-run
backend, launcher and SQLite development remain temporary migration
scaffolding; they are not the production deployment topology.

The exact pre-CR-013 document is preserved in `docs/history/d4-pre-decision/deployment.md`.

## Historical source-product lifecycle evidence

Product release readiness — NOT CLAIMED
```

## Historical local topology

D4-A changes **no deployment topology**.

The product remains:

```text
packaged local application
→ existing launcher
→ local backend on loopback
→ built frontend/local browser UI
→ SQLite + artifacts in external user-data directory
```

Ordinary work requires no cloud service and no mandatory internet connection.

D4-A adds only a startup compatibility gate and product-version identity. The launcher and browser topology are unchanged; user data still lives in the same external user-data directory.

Closed D4-B implements the migration stage and durable UpdateLog under the existing external user-data boundary. It adds no service, cloud dependency or second launcher topology; exact PR-head and merged-head Level-5 verification passed.

## Authorization boundary

The inherited D4 evidence remains closed. ADR 0031 retires its package delivery
surface and the D5 package rehearsal from the FamilyFoodOS forward path. Hosted
deployment remains separately gated and is not implemented by PR1.

## Historical CR-015 lifecycle repair boundary

CR-015 changes no deployment topology: the application remains local-first, the browser remains the UI, and user data remain external to the `.app`. The only authorized runtime change is the native macOS application lifecycle wrapper required for responsive Dock Quit and repeat launch. No cloud, remote management or release-channel work is authorized.

## Historical CR-015 closure deployment truth

The merged native lifecycle repair changes no deployment topology. The browser remains the product UI, the backend remains local, and user data remain external to the `.app`. The fixed package now participates correctly in the macOS application lifecycle for ordinary Quit/restart. D5 still requires a fresh human clean-Mac rehearsal; no remote-management or release topology is authorized.


## Historical CR-017 pilot distribution boundary

The CR-016 self-running downloaded `.command` experiment failed the mandatory human Finder rehearsal because Gatekeeper blocked the bootstrap before execution. CR-017 therefore authorizes only a single-client **operator-assisted** install/update pilot: a qualified support operator may use Terminal to verify the exact package and remove quarantine only from the verified staged `.app`; the client does not type commands. Gatekeeper remains globally enabled. No public/self-service distribution, signing/notarization, Phase 12 or release-readiness claim is created.
