# Current project lifecycle and documentation authority

Status: **CURRENT — NORMATIVE LIFECYCLE PROFILE**
Updated: `2026-08-31`

For historical pre-D4 decision state, see `docs/history/d4-pre-decision/`. The exact pre-decision `docs/current-lifecycle.md` is preserved there byte-identically from base `dc2301f7d4e101ad0fba851325dae9274f02da0c`.

## Authority

- ADR 0030 defines the target FamilyFoodOS consumer delivery as hosted Web/PWA.
- ADR 0031 retires the inherited macOS consumer package and its D5 forward path.
- ADRs 0019–0024 remain accurate historical evidence for the inherited package work; they no longer authorize an active FamilyFoodOS package surface.

- ADR 0016 remains authoritative for destructive Restore.
- ADR 0018 remains authoritative for Restore interaction/validation session semantics.
- ADR 0019 remains authoritative as historical evidence for the bounded D3 macOS package decision.
- ADR 0020 is authoritative for D4 Update Safety.
- ADR 0021 remains authoritative for the historical D5 Remote Install Rehearsal contract.
- ADR 0022 is authoritative for the bounded CR-015 native macOS lifecycle blocker fix discovered by that rehearsal.
- ADR 0023 records the rejected CR-016 self-running bootstrap experiment.
- ADR 0024 remains authoritative for the historical CR-017 single-client operator-assisted install/update pilot decision.
- `docs/roadmap.md` remains historical product-scope evidence for D4 and D5.
- `docs/domain-model-d4-update-safety.md` is the bounded D4 companion clarification.

## Current FamilyFoodOS delivery lifecycle

FamilyFoodOS targets a hosted responsive Web/PWA under ADR 0030. The inherited
macOS consumer `.app` and ZIP build, verification and D5 rehearsal path are
retired under ADR 0031. Source-run backend, launcher, SQLite and Restore remain
transitional development and migration infrastructure; this retirement does
not authorize hosted deployment implementation.

## Historical D4-A closure truth

D4-A implements only the first ADR 0020 slice:

```text
resolve one effective application version
→ inspect canonical database lineage read-only
→ fresh/current/supported-older classification
→ fail closed on incompatible existing lineage
→ only then enter the pre-existing startup backup/migration path
```

Version identity:

- `backend/VERSION` is the one editable build-time product-version source;
- `backend/pyproject.toml` declares its version dynamically from `VERSION`;
- `scripts/package_macos.sh` reads the same source and generates `Info.plist` and `package-runtime.json` projections;
- `scripts/verify_product_version.py` rejects a package whose projections diverge;
- packaged backend runtime reads `package-runtime.json`; source runtime reads `backend/VERSION`;
- Settings/status receives the same effective runtime value;
- the database `app.version` placeholder remains historical and non-authoritative.

Schema compatibility:

- the existing backend migration-lineage classifier remains the one classifier;
- D4-A adds a path-level startup wrapper that opens the canonical DB read-only and calls that classifier;
- only a truly absent canonical path is `fresh`; a dangling symlink, non-file, missing migration history, newer schema, unknown/reordered/skipped history or unreadable DB fails closed;
- `pending_migration_ids()` is no longer used to decide ordinary startup compatibility before the gate;
- D4-A itself originally stopped at the compatibility gate; the now-closed D4-B slice replaces the supported-older direct migration seam with staged migration after that gate.

D4-A, D4-B, D4-C and D4-D are closed. D4 is lifecycle-closed.

## D4-B closure truth

For a supported older canonical database, ordinary user-mode startup now follows the ADR 0020 staged path:

```text
read-only D4-A compatibility preflight
→ reconcile any durable interrupted started operation
→ create + verify before_migration backup
→ create consistent runner-owned stage
→ migrate stage only
→ verify stage target lineage
→ prove canonical unchanged during staging
→ atomically publish stage as canonical
→ verify canonical target lineage
→ durably record completed update
→ continue ordinary post-migration startup
```

`update-journal.json` is external startup-owned metadata under the user-data boundary, not inside the working SQLite database or package. D4-B records `from_app_version = null` because it cannot prove the immediately previous package version: a previous completed update identifies the last migration-producing app, not necessarily the last app that ran. Legacy mutable database `app.version` and SemVer inference are never promoted into authority.

D4-B is **DONE — MERGED AND VERIFIED**. Its accepted Level-5 evidence remains authoritative; D4-C adds presentation only and does not change D4-B migration semantics.

## D4-B closure evidence

- both runs ended `PASS — FULL AUTOMATED SMOKE PASSED`.

## D4-C closure truth

D4-C is **DONE — MERGED AND EXACT-HEAD/EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFIED**. Its implementation remains presentation-only over the D4-B startup authority: bounded read-only Settings status, exactly two packaged update-failure outcomes, no browser update authority, no raw update metadata and no protected Restore changes.

- both trustworthy exact-package runs ended `PASS — FULL AUTOMATED SMOKE PASSED`.

## D4-D closure truth

D4-D is **DONE — FINAL EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFICATION PASSED**. It introduced no runtime implementation. It re-verified the complete D4 manual-update safety contract on exact current main `ec88b09193c8ed041e17daef3e3ffc0193d1b559` using one real packaged `.app`, the full regression/lifecycle/frontend/package path, the D4-C human status/failure scenarios, and the accepted D4-B staged-migration/interruption/newer-lineage matrix.

## D4-D closure evidence

- exact tested main/head: `ec88b09193c8ed041e17daef3e3ffc0193d1b559`;
- final D4-D verifier run: `31751386881`;
- evidence artifact: `9201217317`;
- artifact digest: `sha256:0dc707f8823eb69934a5bc3b3b6824557533bafa3e1e86a7f13fc29c19a1af7d`;
- final result: `PASS — FULL AUTOMATED SMOKE PASSED`.

## D4 closure truth

D4 Update Safety is **DONE — EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFIED AND LIFECYCLE-CLOSED**. CR-013 authorizes no further implementation slice. D5 remains **NOT AUTHORIZED BY CR-013**, and product release readiness remains **NOT CLAIMED**. A future D5 start requires a separate authorization decision/change request.

## Historical D5 decision truth

CR-014 / ADR 0021 defines D5 as a **documentation + exact-package assisted-install rehearsal**, not a release/distribution programme and not a runtime feature.

D5 may update the non-technical install/checklist documents and verify one exact packaged artifact on an explicitly recorded clean Mac or clean macOS user profile. A full D5 PASS requires both automated exact-package evidence and a human Finder/System Settings rehearsal. User steps may not require Terminal, Git, Python, Node.js, Docker, direct SQLite access or repository knowledge.

The current package is unsigned and un-notarized. D5 may document only the normal macOS user-interface approval path actually observed during rehearsal; it may not use `xattr`, `spctl`, `sudo`, global Gatekeeper disabling or any other terminal/security bypass. A D5 PASS is bounded to the exact tested artifact, architecture and macOS environment; it does not imply untested Intel/Apple-Silicon/macOS support.

D5 itself authorizes no backend/frontend/launcher/migration/package-runtime change. A product defect discovered during rehearsal blocks D5 closure and requires its own bounded fix. Signing, notarization, DMG/PKG, App Store, public release hosting, GitHub Releases, release channels, auto-update, MDM/remote-management integration, Phase 12 and product release readiness remain outside CR-014.

## Closed Restore boundary

Restore remains closed. D4-C changes no protected Restore production blob, no Restore state machine, picker, source proof, control plane, backend handshake, replacement or recovery semantics.

## Current release boundary

The inherited D5 package rehearsal and operator-assisted pilot are retired under
ADR 0031. No supported FamilyFoodOS command builds a consumer `.app` or ZIP.
Hosted delivery remains separately gated; this retirement does not authorize
auto-update/download, deployment infrastructure, signing, notarization,
DMG/PKG, App Store, release channels, Phase 12 or release readiness.

## Historical D5 blocker truth

The mandatory human D5 rehearsal on a clean Mac produced a product-level stop condition after successful first launch and normal Gatekeeper approval: the packaged app did not expose a healthy native macOS application lifecycle. The Dock reported the application as not responding; closing the browser did not own or complete application shutdown; and a subsequent Finder launch could not be accepted as a valid restart. This is classified `FAIL — PRODUCT` for the D5 human layer, not a runner failure.

Current code explains the boundary: `CFBundleExecutable` points to a shell bootstrap which `exec`s the bundled Python entrypoint. That Python process owns the local frontend/backend launcher but does not itself run an AppKit application event loop. The previous automated D5 smoke sent SIGTERM directly to that process and therefore did not prove the user-level Dock Quit contract.

CR-015 / ADR 0022 authorizes one bounded repair: make a minimal native AppKit executable the `.app` lifecycle owner; have it launch the existing self-contained bootstrap/runtime as a child; translate ordinary macOS Quit into graceful child termination; remain responsive while shutdown completes; and allow a clean subsequent Finder launch. The native wrapper owns no business logic, domain service, database transaction, migration, backup, Restore or update-safety decision. Browser UI, backend API, launcher, Restore, D4 update safety and external user-data semantics remain authoritative and unchanged.

D5 closure remains blocked until a fresh exact package containing the fix passes both automated package verification and the mandatory clean-Mac/clean-profile human rehearsal. `PHASE 12` and product release readiness remain unauthorized/not claimed.

## Historical CR-015 closure truth

CR-015 native macOS application lifecycle blocker fix is **DONE — MERGED AND EXACT-HEAD/EXACT-PACKAGE VERIFIED**.

Evidence:

- verified implementation head: `d7f95141e5f41c7a806c3fafb71e942fe5892dd8`;

- application-level Quit proof used a macOS Quit Apple event after LaunchServices start; direct child SIGTERM was not accepted as the proof.

D5 itself is **not** complete. The fixed exact package still requires the mandatory fresh human clean-Mac/clean-profile rehearsal and final D5 evidence. Phase 12 and product release readiness remain unauthorized/not claimed.


## Historical CR-016 implementation outcome

CR-016's version-specific downloaded `.command` bootstrap was implemented and automated post-execution behavior passed on head `0179be9fa1758a47662f86c5a14a7f24341815c5` in run `31959318870`. The mandatory clean-Mac Finder rehearsal then produced `FAIL — PRODUCT`: Gatekeeper blocked the quarantined `.command` before it could execute. PR #210 was closed without merge. That self-running bootstrap is not an authorized current implementation target.

## Historical CR-017 operator-assisted pilot truth

ADR 0024 authorizes the next bounded D5 pilot action: a qualified support operator may use Terminal/screen sharing to install or update one known client's exact package after mandatory SHA-256 and app-identity verification. Only the verified staged `.app` may have quarantine removed. The client must not type commands. Gatekeeper stays globally enabled; `sudo`, SIP/security weakening, database/Restore/D4 changes and public distribution remain forbidden.

The operator-assisted path was **AUTHORIZED NEXT — NOT IMPLEMENTED** in the
source-product lifecycle. ADR 0031 now retires that forward path for
FamilyFoodOS. Full D5 PASS, Phase 12 and product release readiness remain
unclaimed.
