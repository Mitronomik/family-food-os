"""The backend-liveness lock: proof that no application backend is still running.

Durable contract: ``docs/backup-and-restore.md`` § 16.3 and `CR-010` § 2.

Restore may not replace the working database while a backend can still write to
it. The launcher proves that by owning the child's process handle — but an
in-memory handle dies with the launcher. After a **hard launcher crash**:

```text
launcher is killed (SIGKILL, power loss, panic)
→ the in-memory Popen handle is gone
→ the uvicorn child keeps running and keeps the database open
→ the next launcher owns no process
→ "nothing was running" — which is false
```

A PID file cannot close that gap: PIDs are reused, so a recorded PID that is
alive today may belong to something else entirely. A listening port cannot close
it either — a port is evidence about a socket, not about which process holds a
database, and during Restore the port is free by design.

What does close it is a lock **held by the backend process itself** for its whole
lifetime. The kernel releases an `fcntl.flock` when the holding process dies, for
any reason, without needing any cleanup code to run. So:

```text
lock is held   → an application backend is alive, whoever started it
lock is free   → no application backend is alive
```

That is a fact about the operating system's process table, not about anything
this application remembered to write down.

## The contract

The launcher passes an exact lock path in `FAMILY_FOOD_BACKEND_LIVENESS_LOCK`
and the backend takes the lock during startup, holding the descriptor open until
the process exits. When the variable is **absent** — the ordinary test client, a
developer importing the app directly — no lock is taken and nothing is claimed;
the launcher is the only thing that sets it, and the launcher is the only thing
that consumes it.

When the variable is present and the lock **cannot** be taken, startup fails.
That means another backend is already alive against this workspace, and serving a
second one would put two writers on one SQLite database.

This module holds one descriptor and nothing else. It is not a process
supervisor, not a daemon, and it has no domain coupling: no route, no table, no
AuditLog event, no migration.
