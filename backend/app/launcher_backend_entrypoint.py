"""The launcher-managed backend entrypoint: lock **and socket** before the app.

Durable contract: ``docs/backup-and-restore.md`` § 16.3 and `CR-010` § 2.

Two ownership facts have to be established before this process may touch the
application, and both of them have to be established *before* the launcher is
told the child started.

## The lock, before any application import

The backend-liveness lock proves that no application backend is alive. That proof
is only as good as the moment the lock is taken, and taking it in the FastAPI
lifespan takes it **too late**:

```text
launcher spawns the child
→ Python starts, imports uvicorn, imports app.main
→ app.main imports every router, every service, the database layer
→ only then does the lifespan run and take the lock
→ the launcher dies hard somewhere inside that window
→ the next launcher sees a free lock and begins destructive work
→ the delayed child finishes importing and opens the database underneath it
```

Everything between "the process exists" and "the lock is held" is a window in
which a launcher-managed backend is invisible to the very check that authorizes
replacing the database it is about to open. So the lock is acquired **before any
application module is imported**, and a child that cannot take it exits without
ever reaching `app.main`.

## The listening socket, before the readiness report

The launcher probes the configured port before spawning this child, but a probe
binds, closes and returns — it establishes availability at an instant and
reserves nothing. Another program can take the port between that probe and the
moment uvicorn binds. Previously uvicorn performed that bind *after* this module
had already reported a successful start, which made a temporary socket conflict
indistinguishable from a real failure:

```text
parent probes the port          ← free
parent spawns the child
child takes the liveness lock
child reports "started"         ← the launcher now believes the backend is up
another program takes the port
child imports uvicorn
uvicorn tries to bind           ← EADDRINUSE, far too late to classify
child exits
```

The launcher then saw a child that started and then died, which during Restore
recovery is a *verification failure* — and a verification failure ends a rollback
at terminal `recovery_blocked`. A busy socket must never be able to do that.

So this module binds the real configured socket itself, before reporting
anything, and uvicorn serves **that already-bound socket**. There is no second
bind, and therefore no window between the proof and the serving.

The order is the whole point, so it is written out literally:

```text
1. parse the launcher's arguments                          stdlib only
2. acquire the backend liveness lock                       ← before any import
3. bind and listen on the exact configured host and port   ← before any import
4a. bind refused with EADDRINUSE:
       report `port-unavailable:<token>` and exit          ← before any import
4b. lock and socket both owned:
       report `ready:<token>`
5. only now import uvicorn and app.main
6. serve the application through the socket bound in step 3
```

A successful readiness report therefore means exactly this, and nothing weaker:

```text
this exact child owns the canonical backend-liveness lock
AND
this exact child owns the actual configured listening socket
```

Steps 4a and 4b are a bounded handshake over an inherited pipe the launcher
created for this one start. The launcher owns the `Popen`, so it can already say
"this child is mine"; the handshake is what lets it also say "this child holds
the lock and the socket", which no health endpoint, PID file or port scan can
establish.

`EADDRINUSE` is the only refusal reported as a port collision. An invalid host,
an unusable address family, a permission failure or any other socket error is a
real startup failure and keeps its ordinary meaning — classifying every socket
problem as "somebody else has the port" would hide genuine misconfiguration
behind a retry instruction. Nothing here parses uvicorn output to infer anything:
the structured, one-run handshake is the authority.

Nothing here discovers, signals or supervises any other process. It is one
process's own startup order, and it exits rather than continuing when the order
cannot be honoured.
