"""CR-004 regressions: the backup engine and the generated-filename grammar.

Durable contract:
``docs/decisions/0015-sqlite-backup-consistency-and-manual-audit.md``.

Every consistency test here reproduces one behaviour the CR-004 diagnostic
measured on merged `main` and that the accepted contract now forbids. They use
barriers and explicit transaction boundaries rather than sleeps, so none of them
depends on timing to be meaningful.
