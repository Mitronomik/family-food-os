"""Read-only inspection of a candidate database's migration lineage.

Durable contract:
``docs/decisions/0016-launcher-assisted-restore.md`` § 3 (`CR-010`) and
``docs/backup-and-restore.md`` § 3.

`C4-I` has to answer two questions about a **staged Restore candidate**: is its
recorded migration history an exact ordered prefix of the chain this application
knows, and does it carry the stable FamilyFoodOS workspace identity? Everything
here exists to answer those questions **without writing to the candidate**.

That rules out the obvious reuse. `app.db.migrations.applied_migration_ids`
calls `_ensure_migration_table`, which issues `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` —
correct for a database the application owns and about to migrate, and exactly
wrong for a candidate that must stay byte-identical to what the user chose. A
read-only connection would make that call fail rather than mutate, but a failure
is not the same answer as "this file has no migration history", and the
distinction decides whether the candidate is rejected or silently repaired.

So this module reads, classifies and reports. It never creates the migration
table, never inserts a row, never runs a migration, and never repairs anything.
It is not a second migration registry: the expected chain still comes from
``app.db.migrations.MIGRATION_MODULES`` through `expected_migration_ids()`, so a
new migration added there is picked up here with no second list to update.
