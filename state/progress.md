## PR4-DATA2 closure

PR #13 merged after `PR4-DATA2 FINAL REVIEW: ACCEPT`.

- accepted head: `918bf81b5da306fc65a57643de515ca1b3fbd1e4`;
- merge/main commit: `2f5fba991f1f612ce7b4b8dfda8ebd41ad6333e7`;
- final corpus: 30 recipes;
- 189 selected ingredient rows;
- exact 81 existing FoodIngredient codes;
- 86 source-backed equipment rows / 34 codes;
- 0 new FoodIngredient;
- 0 unresolved required ingredient rows;
- 0 unresolved required direction-consumables;
- accepted source-specific narrow direct-FNS rights posture.

## PR4 scope reset

The user approved retaining PR #10's Recipe Catalogue runtime while removing obsolete seed/acquisition assumptions.

Superseded as PR4 hard gates:

- old 119-FI historical seed;
- all-servings-6 assumption;
- old 365 ingredient / 315 step / zero-equipment production counts;
- blanket rights inference;
- exact historical retrieval instant requirement;
- fresh-source acquisition as a prerequisite for publishing the accepted DATA2 technical corpus.

`source_retrieved_at` is nullable. Known true instants are stored; unknown values remain `NULL`.

## PR4 delivered candidate

Latest fully tested implementation commit:

`173b0f5479c7af2dd7095bf54f9393b2ff68ba55`

PR #10 contains:

- Recipe and immutable/versioned RecipeVersion;
- ordered RecipeIngredient referencing `food_ingredients`;
- ordered RecipeStep and RecipeEquipment;
- exact Decimal scaling;
- source/rights/verification metadata;
- append-version/current-verified semantics;
- deactivate behavior;
- repository contracts and synchronous SQLAlchemy Core adapters;
- Recipe Catalogue UoW/read scope;
- migration `0024_food_recipe_catalogue` after `0023`;
- DB immutability triggers for version-owned rows;
- deterministic offline DATA2 compiler/seed;
- idempotent seed reconciliation;
- fail-closed validation against accepted per-recipe ingredient selection, equipment order, reviewed steps and step lineage.

Production seed counts:

```text
30 Recipe
30 RecipeVersion v1
189 RecipeIngredient
169 RecipeStep
86 RecipeEquipment
34 equipment codes
81 FoodIngredient codes
```

Ordered steps are durably reviewed in `data/curation/pr4-runtime/recipe-steps.json`. The selected Grilled Fruit variant has three active steps; wooden-skewer soaking is conditional and not active because DATA2 selected a non-wood skewer.

## Verification

### Scope-reset / seed acceptance — run 34001179713

- DATA2 validator PASS;
- DATA2 focused `164 passed`;
- PR4 focused `55 passed`;
- fresh first seed `30/30/189/169/86`, conflicts 0;
- second identical seed 0 inserts, existing `30/30/189/169/86`, conflicts 0;
- compiler regeneration byte-identical;
- full backend+launcher `2983 passed, 2 skipped`;
- Ruff and diff checks PASS;
- final workflow diff empty.

### Final fail-closed hardening — run 34002182325

- DATA2 validator PASS;
- DATA2 focused `164 passed in 3.56s`;
- PR4 focused `58 passed in 15.56s`;
- full backend+launcher `2986 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning in 626.61s`;
- Ruff PASS;
- `git diff --check` and staged diff PASS;
- temporary hardening workflow removed before push;
- new negative regressions prove same-count ingredient mapping drift, equipment-order drift, step-text drift and step-lineage drift are rejected.

## Current gate

PR4 is READY FOR PROJECT FINAL REVIEW, not COMPLETE. PR #10 remains OPEN and must not be merged without explicit post-review user authorization. PR5 remains UNAUTHORIZED.
