"""Packaging/startup verification: the packaged tree can still reach the schema.

D3 does not add a migration runner, a second migration history or any new
startup step. What it *can* break is completeness: a packaging copy that misses
`app/migrations/versions/` produces an application that starts, creates a user
data directory, and then fails on a fresh database — after the user has already
committed to it.

So these tests check two things and claim nothing beyond them:

```text
the migration set the package declares is the repository's current set
the existing startup path still reaches that set, and still backs up first
```

The startup path exercised here is the same `initialize_startup("user")` the
packaged launcher reaches through `launcher.runtime.initialize_backend_startup`.
No packaging-specific startup code exists, which is the point.

This is **packaging/startup verification only**. It is not — and must not be
reported as — the later independent C4-III exact-package Restore verifier, which
exercises the packaged Restore flow against a real built artifact and remains a
separate gate.
