    Owning a `Popen` says the launcher started a process. It does not say the

    ```text
    create a one-run pipe and token

    → the child acquires the lock before importing any application module
    → the child binds and listens on the exact configured socket
    → the child writes `ready:<token>` and closes its end
    → this returns

    above binds a probe, closes it and returns, which establishes availability at
    an instant and reserves nothing; uvicorn used to perform the real bind *after*
    the child had already reported success, so a program that took the port in
    between produced a child that started and then died. During Restore recovery
    that reads as a verification failure, and a verification failure ends a
    rollback at terminal `recovery_blocked` — over a socket. Now the child owns
    the real listening socket before it reports anything, and uvicorn serves that
    same socket rather than binding a second time.

    Timeout, EOF, an early child exit and a token from some other start are all
    the same answer, and all of them stop the child before returning. A backend
    that cannot be accounted for is never left running: that is how an orphan is
    made, and orphans are the failure this whole mechanism exists to prevent.

    A `port-unavailable:` report is the one refusal that is *not* a handshake
    failure. The handshake worked; what it carried was "somebody else has this
    port". The child bound nothing, imported nothing and opened no database, so it
    is raised as the ordinary :class:`BackendPortUnavailableError` — the same type
    and the same message the early probe uses — and Restore turns that into a
