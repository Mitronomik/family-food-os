"""Bounded post-restore backend verification, including restartability.

`CR-010` § 9. Passing every check here is what authorizes the durable transition
to `completed`, and `completed` is what unblocks the ordinary browser. Anything
short of that is a failed Restore that rolls back.

The backend is started through the **existing** launcher/backend boundary —
`launcher.runtime.start_backend_process`, pinned to an explicit
`FAMILY_FOOD_DB_PATH` — so no second uvicorn implementation exists and the
child cannot resolve a fallback database of its own. Readiness is *polled* within
an explicit timeout rather than slept for: a fixed sleep either wastes time or
declares success before the process is listening.

Restartability is proved, not assumed: the whole cycle runs twice against the
exact same path, with a graceful stop in between. A database that serves one
start and fails the next is not a restored workspace.

Each of those cycles is one **exact owned-backend lifetime**, and the launcher's
maintenance lease is handed over for that lifetime and taken back at the end of
it. This module does not implement the handover: it is given a
`run_backend_cycle` callable — in production
:meth:`LauncherLifecycleContext.run_owned_backend_cycle` — and calls it once per
cycle. That is what makes "the lease is reacquired between cycle 1 and cycle 2"
true by construction rather than by convention, and it is why the parameter has
no default: a caller that cannot name who owns the lease has no business starting
a backend against a database mid-Restore.

Response bodies never reach ordinary user output. They are checked here and
discarded; only the fixed category vocabulary is reported outward.
