"""The working-database replacement boundary, and the journal safety it needs.

`CR-010` § 6. Two separate problems live here.

## 1. The target's SQLite sidecars

Replacing `family_food.sqlite` while a `-wal`, `-shm` or `-journal` file
survives beside it is not a replacement — it is a new main database with another
database's transaction state pointed at it. SQLite would then either apply WAL
frames that belong to the *old* file or roll back a hot journal over the *new*
one, and the result is corruption that every structural check would call `ok`.

The fix is SQLite's own lifecycle, not `unlink`. Opening the target and setting
`PRAGMA journal_mode = DELETE` checkpoints any WAL content into the main file and
removes `-wal`/`-shm` through SQLite itself; opening it at all also completes any
pending hot-journal rollback. After the connection closes, the sidecars must
actually be gone — and if any is still there, the launcher **stops** rather than
deleting a file it cannot account for. Blind unlinking is exactly the operation
that turns a recoverable state into a lost one.

This runs after `safety_copy_verified` and before `replacement_intent`: it is a
checkpoint against the working database, so the accepted contract forbids it
until candidate validation has passed and a verified recovery point exists.

## 2. The replacement itself

The working database is never replaced directly from the user-selected path, and
never from the staged candidate either — that file is preserved as recovery
evidence. A separate launcher-owned replacement artifact is created *in the
working database's own directory*, so the publication step can be
`os.replace`: one atomic same-filesystem rename.

The target is not accepted from untrusted input. It is the exact path the
launcher's startup preparation resolved, and `assert_replaceable_target` checks
that before anything is created, so no foreign path can be silently overwritten.

       than reasoned about here.
    2. **`journal_mode = WAL`.** Switching *into* WAL is what removes a rollback
       journal through SQLite. Setting `DELETE` directly does not: a rolled-back
       hot journal is left on disk, which measurement confirmed, and the
       verification below would then refuse a database that is in fact fine.

    this launcher owns it — another process, or a state SQLite would not resolve —

    it. Committed data in a WAL is real user data, and unlinking the WAL would
