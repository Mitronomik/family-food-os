"""The complete candidate-validation contract, run against the staged copy only.

`CR-010` § 3: the staged candidate must pass **all** of this before any mutation,
replacement, deletion, migration, checkpoint or journal cleanup touches the
current working database. Nothing here writes, migrates or repairs anything.

The one rule worth restating: **`PRAGMA quick_check = ok` alone is never
sufficient.** `CR-004` produced `ok` from an empty file, from a WAL-era raw copy
missing every committed row, and from a copy holding two transaction states at
once — and an unrelated healthy SQLite database returns `ok` as well. So
`quick_check` is one condition among many here, and the conditions that actually
identify the file are the migration lineage, stable FamilyFoodOS workspace
identity and the required-table check that follows them.

Schema lineage is read through `app.db.migration_lineage`, a read-only backend
helper. The launcher does not carry its own migration list; the expected chain
stays in `app.db.migrations`.
