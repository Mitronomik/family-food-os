"""The isolated launcher-owned Restore operation directory and its ownership rules.

Every artifact `C4-I` creates lives inside one directory it made itself, under
the application user-data boundary — never inside the SQLite working database,
the repository, the application package or frontend storage.

```text
<user data base>/restore/
  launcher.lock                     exclusive launcher-instance lock
  operation.json                    the one authoritative operation record
  .operation.json.<random>.tmp      transient publication scratch (owned)
  <operation-id>/                   one isolated directory per attempt
    candidate.sqlite                the staged read-only candidate
```

Placement mirrors `app.services.backup.resolve_backup_dir` exactly rather than
inventing a second rule: in user-data mode the directory sits beside `backups/`,
and in development mode it stays next to the configured development database so
a developer run can never write into the real Documents directory.

**Ownership is provable, not assumed.** Cleanup only ever removes paths that
resolve inside a directory this module created, and only names it recognizes.
Nothing here unlinks an arbitrary path, follows a symlink out of the boundary, or
deletes a verified safety copy.
