"""Shared helpers for the `C4-I` Restore tests.

Every helper here builds an **isolated temporary workspace**. Nothing in these
tests touches the real `~/Documents/FamilyFoodOS/` directory, the
repository database or any real user data — `docs/pr-testing-and-smoke-rules.md`
§ 15-16 requires exactly that, and Restore is the operation where getting it
wrong would be least recoverable.

The recognizable marker is one `app_settings` row. It is enough to tell workspace
A from workspace B after a replacement, and it is fake data by construction.

Contexts built here are **real** `LauncherLifecycleContext` objects, acquired the
same way the launcher acquires them, so the canonical-path derivation and the
lock are exercised rather than stubbed. Only the backend child and the startup
migration call are substituted, and only where a real uvicorn start would cost
seconds without proving anything the dedicated tests do not already prove.
