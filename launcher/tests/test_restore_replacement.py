"""The replacement target, its SQLite sidecars, and the atomic boundary.

The sidecar tests are the ones that matter most. Replacing a main database while
a `-wal` or `-journal` survives beside it produces a file that every structural
check calls `ok` and that SQLite will happily corrupt by applying another
database's transaction state to it.

The rule the implementation follows: settle the journal through SQLite's own
lifecycle, then **verify**. Never unlink a sidecar the launcher cannot account
for — committed WAL data is real user data.
