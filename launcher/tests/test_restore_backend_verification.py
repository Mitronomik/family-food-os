"""Bounded post-restore verification against a real backend child.

These are the only Restore tests that start uvicorn, and they are the ones that
have to: everything the accepted contract calls "verification" — the exact
database path reaching the child, the health payload, the representative reads,
the graceful stop and the second start — is a property of the real process
boundary, not of a stub.

They are deliberately few. The phase machine, the fault matrix and the recovery
table are proved elsewhere without paying for a process start each.
