"""The exclusive launcher-instance boundary.

One lock covers ordinary startup, Restore execution and incomplete-Restore
recovery, so a second launcher cannot enter the protected lifecycle while the
first is inside it. The concurrency proof uses a real second **process**: an
`fcntl.flock` is held per open file description, so two locks taken in one
process would not exercise the property that matters.
