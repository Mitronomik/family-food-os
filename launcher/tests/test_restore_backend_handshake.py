"""Pre-import lock acquisition, and the proof that *this* child made it.

Two findings meet here, and they are the same finding seen from two ends.

**The lock was taken too late.** It was acquired in the FastAPI lifespan, which
runs after Python has imported uvicorn, `app.main`, every router and the database
layer. Everything before that is a window in which a launcher-managed backend
exists and holds nothing:

```text
launcher spawns the child
→ child is importing the application, holding no lock
→ launcher dies hard
→ the next launcher sees a free lock and begins destructive work
→ the delayed child finishes importing and opens the database underneath it
```

The existing hard-crash test waits for the backend to be *ready* before killing
the helper, so it never entered this window at all.

**Owning a handle did not prove the lock.** `Popen` says the launcher started a
process; it does not say the process took the lock. Health does not either — it
answers after the import this whole mechanism exists to gate.

So the child acquires the lock before importing anything from the application and
reports that over a one-run inherited pipe, and the launcher waits for that exact
report. The decisive test below really pauses a real child before its acquisition,
really `os._exit()`s its launcher, and then checks what the delayed child can do
once a new launcher owns the workspace.
